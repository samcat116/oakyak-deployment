# OakYak Deployment
Deployment of the OakYak Application on Kuberenetes

## Overview
This repository contains all the necesary configurations to deploy the OakYak application on Kubernetes. This repo goes with the associated blog post going over how to deploy applications to Kubernetes.

## Deployment
This app is deployed to Kubernetes using Github Actions. I have it running on Digital Ocean's managed K8s platform, however the nice thing about Kubernetes is that this could easily be deployed anywhere.
